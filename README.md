## Explaination about Task

I have used React to build it and used css for designing it. There is a folder named "public" which contains index.html . There is a folder named "src" which contains index.js , App.js and styles.css file along with "PageParts" folder. Pageparts folder contains main files of the page. it has components of body, heading and a courses folder. Body component mainly contains courses that are present in home page. Courses folder have templates and css files for courses page, and other features like, dropdown menus, forms for feedback, displaying review, etc.
