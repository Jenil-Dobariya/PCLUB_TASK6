It is react app. If you want to launch it locally, just download file and type ```npm start``` in terminal.

## Explaination about Task

I have used React to do this task.

There is a folder named "public" which contains index.html.

There is a folder named "src" which contains index.js , App.js and styles.css file along with "PageParts" folder. In index.js, I have created a root and rendered it with App component. In App.js, I imported two components one for body and one for heading.

Pageparts folder contains main files of the page. it has components of body, heading and a courses folder. Body component mainly contains courses that are present in home page. I have added only 4 courses for now. Courses folder have three templates named feedBack Form, Review, DropDown. These three and some other contents together makes template for course site, named courseTemplate.js . There are CSS file for each JS file for designing of the page. There is not any CSS file for dropDown template as I added its design into courseDesign .css .

## My Experience

It took much efforts but I finally did it :)

This task gave me a good learning experience and help me to enhance my skills. I learned some new things like, using components as templates.
